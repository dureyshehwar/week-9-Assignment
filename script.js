/**Coding Steps:
**The completed project should, when executed, do the following:
1. Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards.
2. Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.
3. The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point.
   -Ties result in zero points for both Players.
4. After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.

// what to we nedd for this War Game step by step:::::
/* Deck

 * 52 cards (should each card be its on class? should it be an object withh 3 values?)
 * Rank ("name value")
 * suits (heart , spade , club , diamond )
 * Values
 * a way to shuffle
 * a way to pass the cards to the players(should be this in my deck or my gmae logic?)
 * 
 * Player( do I need a player class? //or can I just put in my gmae logic?)
 * Name 
 * Score 
 * Hand
 * 
 * Logic to Actually play the Game.....we can use a deck in my card Game.
 *  but we are playing a specific one.
 *  ways to compare the cards....number values one each card
 *
